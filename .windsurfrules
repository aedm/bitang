Make a plan before you modify anything.
Think about a plan and pinpoint its weaknesses and possible improvements.

Always run "cargo.exe run --profile dev-nowarn" to verify that the code compiles.
Ignore the linter unless explicitly asked.
Only do modifications that were explicitly asked for, absolutely do not make any additional changes even if you think it would be a good idea.
